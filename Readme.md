# CRUD - Payroll (2016)

This is a college work introduced in the PPL discipline (Paradigms of Programming Languages) whose objective is to demonstrate the use of the COBOL language in business software. A small CRUD financial management software was developed, capable of calculating a payroll following the labor laws in 2016 (Brazil).
